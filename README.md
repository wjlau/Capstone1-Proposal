## Capstone I Proposals 

1. ### NBA Home-Court Advantage (With and Without Fans)
	* For team sports, people often argue that teams tend to perform better when competing at their own arena vs traveling to another. Is "home-court advantage" real? Additionally, how much of a thing is "home-court advantage" with fans vs. without? Given, the current climate, fans have not been allowed to attend live sporting events. How has this affected the idea of "home-court advantage"?

2. ### Movies and Their Sequels 
	* Often times beloved movies are followed with underwhelming sequels, or so it feels like it (at least for me). Are the original movies better? Do people rate the original movies higher than their sequels?

3. ### Fatalities Due to Vehicle Collisions
	*  Are accidents in the winter more dangerous (more fatalies) compared to the summer?
